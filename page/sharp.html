                The Sharpshooter is one of the precision perks available in Killing Floor 2.
                Sharpshooters excel greatly in killing larges and they can hold their
                own when it comes to trash. Players who are trying to learn the Sharpshooter
                perk should adopt a calm mindset because the perk is very difficult to learn.

                    The M14 is a very well rounded weapon that can deal with trash and larges fairly well.
                    Due to the its low-recoil, the M14 preforms well in almost any situation.

                    <br><br>
                    Since the M14 is very easy to use, many Sharpshooters adopt the M14 into their loadout.

                    The FAL is the only fully automatic weapon available on the Sharpshooter. It's rapid fire capability
                    makes the FAL the highest Damage Per Second (DPS) gun that Sharpshooter has to offer! However, due
                    its extreme
                    recoil, the FAL's effective range is only close up.
                    <br><br>
                    The FAL is a monster for any player who can tame the recoil and it's a great alternative to the M14.

                    Due to its tube fed maganzine, the SPX should be reserved for only larges or any high priority Zed.

                <p class='gun-text'>
                    The Winchester is the starting weapon for Sharpshooter. The performance is almost identical to the
                    SPX,
                    with the Windchester having a larger maganzine but lower damage per shot.
                    <br><br>
                    The Winchester is a great budget weapon since it can decap rioters in a single shot and deal with
                    single
                    larges when combined with a freeze. The base Winchester will stay relevant until Wave 4.

                <p class='gun-text'>
                    The Mosin is one of the unique weapons in Killing Floor 2. It is the first gun to introduce a melee
                    accessory and blocking functionality
                    outside the Beserker perk. Due to its high damage per shot, the Mosin should be reserved for only
                    larges or high priority targets; using only
                    the melee for trash that gets close. One of biggest flaws with the Mosin is its slow reload and fire
                    rate.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the Mosin can block. Players are suggested to place a Mosin on the <a href='#' class='link'>kite</a> to act
                    as a tank for the team.

                    The Crossbow is one of the single shot weapons available on the Sharpshooter.
                    Its high damage, stun power, and penetration, the Crossbow is a top contender for large takedowns.
                   You can also pickup the bolts that pass through Zeds off the ground or wall.

                    Due to its unwieldy nature, the Crossbow is very difficult to use; even when the Crossbow

                     The Compound Bow is the big brother of the Crossbow (sort of). It preforms exactly
                     the same as the Crossbow, but also has a draw time. Just use the Crossbow in the end.


                     <br><br>
                    The alt fire does not reliably freeze larges. The time it takes to actually freeze a large, is pretty the same as
                    killing it. If a stun is needed, the natural stun power of the normal arrow should suffice.

                    The 1858 is the single version of the starting weapons for the Gunslinger.
                    Not necessarily powerful base level but can pack a punch once upgraded. Its low
                    damage compared to other guns make it a subpar choice.
                     <br><br>
                     Due to its low recoil, the 1858 can be easily mag dumped in a large. This can easily
                     lead to some high noon action.

                     The Winchester is the starting weapon for Sharpshooter. The performance is almost identical to the
                     SPX,
                     with the Windchester having a larger maganzine but lower damage per shot.
                     <br><br>
                     The Winchester is a great budget weapon since it can decap rioters in a single shot and deal with
                     single
                     larges when combined with a freeze. The base Winchester will stay relevant until Wave 4.

                    These are the skills you want to run for optimal
                    play 99% of the time. I'll mainly explain why you want THIS over the other skill.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            Sharpshooters mainly want Marksman for its firerate bonus. Since most players will be running multishot weapons,
                            their DPS and flexibility actually increases a lot more in general from the firerate than the flat damage that Sniper provides.
                            The added movement speed from Marksman is just a cherry on top; which on its own grants increased survivability. 
                            <br><br>
                            Sniper should be only considered when using a single shot weapon like the Crossbow and the lane is super long.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Any multifiring perk should take advantage of crouching whenever possible. Using
                            Stability takes the benefits of crouching and cranks it up to 11. It's literally
                            free damage, reload speed, and movement speed while crouched. 
                            <br><br>
                            Balistic Shock is only viable when paired with the crossbow and in Spawn Cycles that forces the team to kite constantly.

                        <p>
                            Rack em Up is just too good to pass up. The extra damage on top of Sharpshooter's absurd
                            headshot damage is quite broken. Most of the benefits from tactical reload are hardly noticeable
                            and can be substituted with <a href='#' class='link'>reload-cancelling</a> and  <a href='#' class='link'>'V-Loading'</a>.

                        <p>
                            You mainly want Always Prepared because of the extra Freeze Grenade that it provides. If
                            your environment allows skill swapping, consider <a href='#' class='link'>Over-Capping</a> to receive the benefits of Dead-Eye.

                        <p>
                            Having Assassin active during Zed Time basically acts if you had Medic buffs applied to your headshots.
                            If you're a Big Zed Hunter, you'll definitely want Assassin.
                        </p>
                        <h2> OR </h2>
                        <h2><img src='../resources/images/sharp/ranger.png'>Level 25: Ranger</h2>
                        <p> 
                            If taming a group of larges is more practical in your lane, then Ranger is the optimal choice. Headshots during Zed Time
                            have increase stun power. Which allow Sharpshooters to stun scrakes in 1-3 shots.

                            <br><br>
                            Special Note: On Tamari Servers, Ranger has been reverted to pre-buff Ranger. And stunning a Fleshpound is typically only possible
                            with the Mosin, Crossbow, or Compound Bow.

                            <br><br>
                            Overall both lvl. 25 skills offer the increase Zed Time activation chance and are both excellent options.

                        In general, a Sharpshooter should attempt to aim for the head in order to make full use of their
                        perk's passive Damage Bonus.
                        <br><br>
                        One commonly overlooked mechanic is the Level 25 Sharpshooter's ability to trigger ZED Time via
                        their Ranger and Assassin skills.
                        These skills offer a 5% chance to trigger ZED Time immediately upon scoring a headshot, which
                        can be pivotal to the outcome of the game.
                        Thus, it's in a Sharpshooter's best interest to score headshots as often as possible to increase
                        the likelihood of this occurring.
                        Sharpshooters in CD can be generally classified under two distinct playstyles:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Big Zed Hunter</li>
                        <li>Headclicker</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <div class='big-zed-hunter'>
                    <h2>Big Zed Hunter</h2>

                    <p>
                        Big Zed Hunters are the highest damage dealers of the Precision Perks outside of Zed Time.
                        Sharpshooters
                        who primarily use the SPX for their takedowns would be classified as a <span
                            style='font-style: italic;'>Big Zed Hunter.</span>

                        <br><br>

                        Primarily using the SPX offers some major advantages in terms of DPS:
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <h2>+Pros</h2>
                        <li>Decapitate (decap) any medium in a single shot</li>
                        <li>Decap Fleshpounds before they start charging</li>
                        <li>Decap Two Fleshpounds before reloading</li>
                        <li>Melt Scrakes like butter with Medic Buffs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        But, primarily using the SPX comes with its own flaws:


                    <ul>
                        <h2>-Cons</h2>
                        <li>Suffers in handling hordes of Zeds</li>
                        <li>Extremely long reloads. (Can be mitigated by <a href='#' class='link'>'V-Loading'</a>)</li>
                        <li>Very situational</li>
                        <li>Needs Intense Concentration to use effectively far ranges.</li>
                        <li>Less Shots = Less Zed Time</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Big Zed Hunter is best utlized when laned with a teammate who can take care of trash for
                        you.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class='head-clicker'>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Headclicker</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Headclicker offers a more flexible Playstyle compared to the Big Zed Hunter. Since
                        the Headclicker mainly uses the FAL or M14 as their primary weapon, they can effectively handle
                        both trash and larges in any situation.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <h2>+Pros</h2>
                        <li>Can be used in any situation</li>
                        <li>The prefered Playstyle when soloing a lane</li>
                        <li>Easiest Playstyle to adopt</li>
                        <li>More Zed Time Activations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h2>-Cons</h2>
                        <li>Practically None</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Despite the Headclicker having no real downsides. There is some situations where the Big Zed
                        Hunter is better than a Headclicker
                        and a master Sharpshooter should be able to switch Playstyles when the situation calls for it.

                <h2>M14 +1/FAL & SPX +2</h2>
                <p>
                    The M14 +1/FAL & SPX +2 is the current meta for Killing Floor 2 CD. It offers high flexibility
                    with the M14 or FAL and crazy burst DPS with the SPX.

                    <br> <br>
                    Players are encouraged to buy SPX wave 2 to deal with early larges. Afterwards, players can decide
                    whatever route to take to complete the loadout depending on the situation.
                </p>
                <h2>Mosin & M14 +1</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mosin & M14 is another excellent loadout available for the Sharpshooter. The M14 offers the main DPS
                    for the loadout, with the mosin acting as a sniper for long range take downs and off-perk tanking.
                    <br><br>

                    Players should grab the M14 first because the Mosin itself is more of a tool than a weapon.

                        <p>
                            One of the strongest attacks you can do with
                            Sharpshooter is to freeze a group of fleshpounds,
                            then quickly dispatch two fleshpounds with the SPX +2.

                            Don't suggest doing this often since people can potentially rerage
                            the fleshpound and potentially kill you, but it is a handy trick to know.

                        <p>
                            One of the biggest advantages that Sharpshooters have
                            would be their range. If you're laned with other teammates;
                            consider shooting stuff that's in the back instead of the front.
                            This allows you to thin out the horde and take out high priority targets
                            such as Fleshpounds or Husks.

                            , tap the reload key, then continue kiting.

                        <p>
                            Being a Sharpshooter doesn't mean you are bounded to the floor.
                            Unless you have <a href='#' class='link'>'Bone-Itis</a>. Sharpshooters are
                            basically mini gunslingers while standing. Their damage potential
                            stays relatively high without the Stability skill active (very useful while kiting).

                            Since most Sharpshooters are in the back, they typically
                            take less damage. If you have armor left, body block
